# Tango

## Tango is a set of powerful functional tools for your .NET C# application.


### Introduction

In certainly way any C# developer work with some functional concepts like anonymous methods with lambda expressions and high order functions with Linq library, and so on.

C# is an amazing programming language and we as a dev, can improve it a lot more. In this library I implements some of the core functional concepts in order to enhances the experience of developers.

### How to use
This library is avaiable at [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Tango/).

```
Install-Package Tango
```

> *WARNING*
>
> The current version at NuGet is not the lastest version.
> The NuGet version will be updated by the time I finished the documentation.

There are a lot of awesome front-end frameworks out there these days. They provide a massive quantity of useful features making our lives more comfortable. Our intention is not to create a new one as we are pretty much aware of the complexity and amount of work developers put on their creations. But as developers, we feel that nowadays front-end development is disjointed. You have to search for libraries, go through the different installation process, everything looks different, and sometimes it's just annoying that you can't just sit and start going. That's why we are on a mission to assemble together the most usefule modules and libraries, join them with a unified application and graphical interface creating a great toolkit for easier setup.

### From me
I spent some time to create this library for improving the way of any dev can uses C# and functional programming concepts together.
