# Tango

## Tango is a set of powerful functional tools for your .NET C# application.


### Introduction

In certainly way any C# developer work with some functional concepts like anonymous methods with lambda expressions and high order functions with Linq library, and so on.

C# is an amazing programming language and we as a dev, can improve it a lot more. In this library I implements some of the core functional concepts in order to enhances the experience of developers.
